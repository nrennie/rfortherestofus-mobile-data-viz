## Personal Background

### How did you get into R?

* I think the first time I ever used R was about 9 or 10 years in an undergraduate statistics class, and I hated it so much. I'd never done any sort of programming before and I very much felt like I was thrown into the deep end. It just didn't click at all.
* The rest of my degree programme I mainly used Python
* Masters - more R focused
* Deutsche Bahn


### Give me an overview of the type of work you do. What does your use of R on a daily basis look like?

* lecturer in health data science, data processing health-related data, statistical models, visualisation for papers 
* I also use R for developing teaching materials in combination with RMarkdown or Quarto - that might be lecture slides, lecture notes, course website, simulated data sets for workshops, developing tutorials for R. I use parameterised document a lot of the time, to create a tutorial sheet for students with questions, and then switching the parameter in the report also prints the solutions.
* data visualisation, partly for fun, RSS Best practices for data visualisation guidance (and r package)


### You are clearly very into data viz? Where does that interest come from?

* At first glance, most probably see the PhD in statistics, think oh she works with data, that must be how she got into data visualisation
* I actually I don't think my foray into data viz came from stats or data at all
* favourite subjects art and music not maths and computer science
* I wanted to do something more creative, and I wanted to get better at programming. 

### Why do you think R is well suited to making high-quality data viz?

* reproducible
* photoshop
* packages that exist / community, annotations
* automate, build style packages 
* interface with other languages, if you do really need that excel sheet

### What do you recommend for someone who wants to get into making data viz in R or improve their existing data viz?

* Just start! tidytuesday
* Look at news articles - can you remake them? how would you do it better
* Pen and paper
* what's the purpose - eye ctaching or accurately displaying information

## Data Viz on Mobile

Can you give an example of a piece of data viz that you have made for large screens and how you might adapt it for mobile?

You suggest there are three problems when making mobile-friendly data viz:

1.	You need to set a specific size of plot
2.	You need to save a high resolution image (that matches what you seen on screen)
3.	You have a lot less space to work with!

Talk about these problems and the solution to each.
