## Personal Background

### How did you get into R?

### Give me an overview of the type of work you do. What does your use of R on a daily basis look like?

### You are clearly very into data viz? Where does that interest come from? 

### Why do you think R is well suited to making high-quality data viz?

### What do you recommend for someone who wants to get into making data viz in R or improve their existing data viz? 

## Data Viz on Mobile

Can you give an example of a piece of data viz that you have made for large screens and how you might adapt it for mobile?

You suggest there are three problems when making mobile-friendly data viz:

1.	You need to set a specific size of plot
2.	You need to save a high resolution image (that matches what you seen on screen)
3.	You have a lot less space to work with!

Talk about these problems and the solution to each.
